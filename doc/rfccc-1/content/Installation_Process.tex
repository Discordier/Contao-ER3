\section[sec:installation process]{Installation Process}

The Extension Manager (fka ER Client) use an installer class to install, upgrade, downgrade and uninstall extensions.
Every extension can use the basic installer, a modification of the basic installer or a complete own implementation.

An own implementation of the installer can be used to create individual installers.
For example the installer can fetch the extension files in the installation process.
